# jsradio
An online radio using moment.js and howler.js.

jsradio uses moment.js to get the seconds since midnight so audio can be synced across devices giving the impression that it's live. howler.js is used for handling audio files for compatibilty and performance reasons.

the files are pretty large for the radio but i tried to make it work as well as I could. sometimes the files cause the browser to crash or just dont work at all.

I think this is pretty cool and has several practical uses. People can use this however they want because this project is pretty cool and barebones.
